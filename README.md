# decentralized-KYC-validation-Solidity
KYC (Know Your Customer) is a service provided by financial institutions such as banks. There are both public and private sector banks managed by a central bank. These banks are banned by the central bank from adding any new customer and do any more customer KYCs as they see suspicious activities that need to be sorted out first. Despite this, the banks add new customers and do the KYC in the background.
